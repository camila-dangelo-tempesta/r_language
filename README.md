# R Language

## Big Data Analytics with R and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning

R is a versatile language, developed by two researchers from the Department of Statistics at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. It arose from the need for a program to assist in the manipulation, analysis and visualization of data. Being Open-Source and with a very active community, R is constantly being updated.

It can be used for a variety of activities, such as:
* Data extraction
* Data Cleaning
* Loading and
* Data Transformation
* Statistical analysis
* Predictive Modeling
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization

## 1. Challenge

This entire section will be dedicated to laboratory studies of Data Analysis, with real and public data, using R language. In this context I intend to address several business problems in order to solve them improving my technical skills.

|:--------------|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------|:--------------------------------|:---------------------|
| **Lab_01**    | Big data loading via RStudio memory manager | In this project, the objective is to work with the memory manager offered by RStudio, in order to load a large set of data for then establish a high performance analysis process | Study of the increase in world temperatures over the years. Where, I have the evolution of temperatures in 3 Brazilian cities: Recife, Curitiba and Palmas | Berkeley Earth: https://lnkd.in/eixEDCcW |
| **Lab_02**    | Analytics Web App for Big Data | In this project, the objective is to work with data from 7 different sources, clean, organize and combine this data, and then build an analytical dashboard web app to understand the relationship between Netflix's revenue and PIB and social inequality indicators for each country where Netflix operates, in addition to other analyzes | How Does PIB and Social Inequality Influence Netflix's Growth?| 1.IMDB: https://lnkd.in/e2Dki2hf 2.Netflix: https://lnkd.in/euigQR8g 3.PIB: https://lnkd.in/ecfPV7Qd 4.Wage Inequality: https://lnkd.in/eQwfqNT4 5.Top 10 Netflix: https://top10.netflix.com/ 6.Netflix subscribers: https://lnkd.in/ex9NgsSF 7.Country Code: https://lnkd.in/efJCXbxW |
| **Lab_03**    | Data Science in Retail with Market Basket Analysis | In this project, the objective is to work with a mining technique of data, Market Basket Analysis | In a store or supermarket, if Customer A buys bananas, does he also buy apples? If true, how strong is this relationship? If we have another Customer B similar to Customer A, what are the chances that, when buying bananas, they also buy apples? How does this affect our Marketing campaigns? | Stanford: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon-meta.html |
| **Lab_04**    |             |                                          |                            |
