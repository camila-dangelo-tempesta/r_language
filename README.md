# R Language

## Big Data Analytics with R and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning

R is a versatile language, developed by two researchers from the Department of Statistics at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. It arose from the need for a program to assist in the manipulation, analysis and visualization of data. Being Open-Source and with a very active community, R is constantly being updated.

It can be used for a variety of activities, such as:
* Data extraction
* Data Cleaning
* Loading and
* Data Transformation
* Statistical analysis
* Predictive Modeling
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization

## 1. Challenge

This entire section will be dedicated to laboratory studies of Data Analysis, with real and public data, using R language. In this context I intend to address several business problems in order to solve them improving my technical skills.
