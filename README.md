# R Language

## Big Data Analytics with R and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning

R is a versatile language, developed by two researchers from the Department of Statistics at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. It arose from the need for a program to assist in the manipulation, analysis and visualization of data. Being Open-Source and with a very active community, R is constantly being updated.
