# R Language

## Big Data Analytics with R and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning

R is a versatile language, developed by two researchers from the Department of Statistics at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. It arose from the need for a program to assist in the manipulation, analysis and visualization of data. Being Open-Source and with a very active community, R is constantly being updated.

It can be used for a variety of activities, such as:
* Data extraction
* Data Cleaning
* Loading and
* Data Transformation
* Statistical analysis
* Predictive Modeling
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization

## 1. Business Problem.

This entire section will be dedicated to laboratory studies of Data Analysis, with real and public data, using R language. In this context I intend to address several business problems in order to solve them improving my technical skills.

## 2. Laboratories

***
- [x] **Lab 01:** Memory management, RStudio, for loading large datasets

   * **Scopo:** In this project, the objective is to work with the memory manager offered by RStudio, in order to load a large set of data for then establish a high performance analysis process.
    
   * **Project:** Study of the increase in world temperatures over the years. Where, I have the evolution of temperatures in 3 Brazilian cities: Recife, Curitiba and Palmas.
